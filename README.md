# textfeatureinfo

This python package includes functions assisting data scientists to extract information from text features that can be useful in their data science projects. The four-in-one simple tool will help gather summary information from plain text such as the number of punctuations appeared, the average word lengths, the mostly appeared words; and also to manipulate text data by removing the stopwords for the ease of future processing steps. 

Our package and functions are inspired from a lab of 573 (Feature and model selection) course of UBC MDS program, and are tailored based on our own experience and interest. Some published libraries/methods with similar functionalities may include the following:
